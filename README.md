Projectile_Motion Calculator
A simple desktop GUI application that calculates and visualizes projectile motion characteristics for a given initial velocity and launch angle.

What Is This Project?
This app lets users enter an initial velocity (m/s) and a launch angle (degrees) and then:

Plots the range vs. launch angle curve for angles from 0° to 90° at the given velocity, highlighting the angle that yields the maximum range.

Plots the trajectory (height vs. horizontal distance) of the projectile for the user-specified launch angle.

Key Features
Interactive GUI: Enter velocity and angle easily.

Range Curve Plot: Visualizes how range changes with launch angle.

Trajectory Plot: Shows the parabolic flight path for chosen inputs.

Input Validation: Ensures angle is between 0 and 90 degrees.

Result Popup: Displays maximum range and optimal angle.

Prerequisites
Python 3.7 or later

matplotlib library installed (pip install matplotlib)

Installation & Running
Clone or download the project files.

Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install matplotlib
Run the app:

python app.py
Usage
Enter the initial velocity in meters per second (e.g., 30).

Enter the launch angle in degrees (between 0 and 90).

Click Calculate & Plot.

View the two plots:

Range vs. launch angle curve with max range marked.

Trajectory of the projectile at your chosen angle.

See a popup summarizing the maximum range and optimal angle.
