Projectile_Motion Calculator

A simple desktop GUI application that calculates and visualizes projectile motion characteristics for a given initial velocity and launch angle.



What Is This Project?

This app lets users enter an initial velocity (m/s) and a launch angle (degrees), then:

Plots the range vs. launch angle curve** for angles from 0° to 90°, highlighting the angle that gives the maximum range.
Plots the projectile trajectory** (height vs. horizontal distance) for the user-specified launch angle


Key Features

- Interactive GUI – Enter velocity and angle easily.
- Range Curve Plot – Visualizes how range changes with launch angle.
- Trajectory Plot – Shows the parabolic flight path for chosen inputs.
- Input Validation** – Ensures angle is between 0 and 90 degrees.
- Result Popup – Displays maximum range and optimal angle.

 Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or later  
- `matplotlib` library
